    "targetPrice": 35.0,
    "rationale": "Despite negative sentiment and downward earnings revisions, Capri Holdings' current price of $43.74 appears overvalued given the significant headwinds facing the luxury goods industry, including slowing economic growth, geopolitical tensions, and changing consumer preferences. The competitive landscape and cyclical risks further threaten CPRI's ability to maintain its market position and profitability. A target price of $35.0 reflects these challenges and the potential for further downside. Investors should consider selling CPRI and reallocating capital to more promising opportunities."

In this single-company analysis, Capri Holdings (CPRI) ranks as the least attractive investment opportunity in the fashion industry. The rationale highlights the negative sentiment, weak financial performance, industry headwinds, competitive pressures, and cyclical risks that make CPRI an unappealing investment at its current price of $43.74. The target price of $35.0 suggests a significant potential downside, and investors are advised to sell their positions in favor of more promising opportunities in the luxury goods industry or other sectors with better growth prospects and lower risks.
